                      Boracay is an island in the Philippines that's been a
                      popular vacation destination for many years. It's located
                      just a few kilometers off the northwest coast of Panay, so
                      it's easy to get there by boat or plane. Boracay has a total
                      land area of 10.32square kilometers (3.98 sq mi), underthe
                      jurisdiction of three barangays in Malay, Aklan. The Ati
                      people were the original inhabitants of Boracay, but
                      commercialdevelopment has led to their severemarginalization
                      over time. You canexplore Boracay while driving

                  <p class="text-center">
                    The Banaue Rice Terraces are a National Cultural Treasure of the Philippines and are considered to
                    be the 8th Natural Wonder of the World by many Filipinos.
  
                    The terraces are carved in the mountains of Ifugao and were most likely done by hand.
  
                    There have been rice terraces in the mountainous regions of Ifugao and northern Luzon Island for
                    over 2,000 years.
  
                    The terraces were first constructed as a practical solution to the problem of growing rice on land
                    that falls away in front of you at vertigo-inducing angles.
  
                    The terraces were created by being built up step by step with stone walls that were connected by
                    wooden walkways, stairs and ladders.

                    Chocolate Hills is a geological formation in the Bohol province of the Philippines. There are at
                    least 1,260 hills, but there may be as many as 1,776 hills spread over an area of more than 50
                    square kilometers (20 sq mi). They are covered in green grass that turns brown during the dry
                    season, hence the name.
  
                    The Chocolate Hills are located on Panglao Island, Bohol and stretch from Talibon to Tagbilaran.
                    The chocolate hills of Bohol were declared as a National Park in January 18, 2001. The Chocolate
                    Hills have been described as "the most photographed natural wonder in the world".
  
                    The chocolate hills were named after their resemblance to chocolate candies. The word "chocolate"
                    was chosen because it was similar to the way people thought about them at first sight.
  
                    The Chocolate Hills are made up of limestone formations that formed millions of years ago from the
                    seeping out of water due to underground volcanic activity. The formations were formed by water
                    erosion over time leaving behind these sandstone formations.

                Coron is the third-largest island in the Calamian Islands in northern Palawan in the Philippines. The island is part of the larger municipality of the same name. It is about 170 nautical miles (310 km) southwest of Manila and is known for several Japanese shipwrecks of World War II vintage. Because of its unique ecological features, the entire area is protected by several legal proclamations.

                The island and surrounding fishing grounds are part of the ancestral domain of the indigenous Tagbanwa people, officially designated such on June 5, 1998. Known as Calis among the Tagbanwas and Coronians, its tribal chieftain is Rodolfo Aguilar I.

                The island comprises two barangays of the municipality of Coron: Banuang Daan and Cabugao.

                As soon as your flight lands at the airport in Bicol International Airport of Albay province, the worldâ€™s most perfect volcanic cone, and the most active volcano in the Philippines, greets you with its majesty. Mayon Volcano is one of the most beautiful places to visit in the Philippines and is a top attraction in any Bicol tour.

                Its sheer beauty (the name Mayon comes from the Bicolano word â€˜magayon,â€™ which means beautiful) hides a violent core, with past eruptions that flattened several towns.

                One of the top natural landmarks in the Philippines and one of the most-visited tourist spots in Albay, it is already a wonderful experience seeing the volcano from afar. But if you are an adrenaline junkie, you can soak up all its beauty while gliding through a zipline in Lignon Hill or going on a Mayon Volcano tour via motorcycle ride in Bicol. Visit the Cagsawa Ruins for another unique and historic viewing point of the Mayon Volcano.

                As a bonus, from Legazpi, you can take a side trip to Donsol, where you can see whale sharks peacefully basking in their natural habitat.
